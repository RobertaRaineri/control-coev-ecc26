Simulations for the paper *"On a Closed-loop Controller for the Coevolutionary Model of Actions and Opinions via Broadcasting Information"* by Raineri R., Ye M, and Zino L. - submitted to European Control Conference 2026. 

### Paper Abstract ###
This paper deals with the problem of controlling a complex social network in which agents have actions and opinions that coevolve, mutually influencing one another. We consider a control input consisting in broadcasting information to a target set of agents, with the objective of steering the whole population, initially at a consensus, to a different consensus state. 
First, we consider the scenario of a constant control input. After deriving a monotone convergence result for the controlled dynamics, we build on that result to derive an algorithm that determines whether a target set is sufficient to achieve the desired objective and an effective heuristic to optimize the target set. 
Second, we introduce a feedback control law that, using information on the state of the system, dynamically revises the target set, ultimately reducing the control effort needed to achieve the objective, while guaranteeing convergence to the desired consensus state. 
The proposed methodology is explored and validated through numerical case studies.
